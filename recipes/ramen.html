      <h1>all natural ramen noodles</h1>

      <img src="../img/ramen.jpg">

      <h2>no MSC or artifical ingredients</h2>

      <p>I've tried those make-your-own ramen seasoning recipes, but they taste nothing like ramen in my opinion. This recipe hits the spot, and there is no MSG or artificial ingredients.</p>

      <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, and scallions.</p>
