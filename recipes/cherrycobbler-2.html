      <h1>Cherry Cobbler 2</h1>

      <img src="../img/cherry-cobbler-lede.jpg">

      <h2>A traditional recipe</h2>

      <p>This was handed down by my Grandmother. You can use any kind of fruit filling. If using cherry, pie filling can be substituted with 2 cups fresh cherries.</p>

      <p>It is said that the cherry cobbler originated in the early British American colonies and came about as a lack of appropriate ingredients and cooking equipment. The English missed their traditional suet puddings and settled for baking cherry cobblers.</p>
